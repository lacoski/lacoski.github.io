<section id="main">
  <h1 itemprop="name" id="title">Why are you still shopping offline?</h1>
  <div>
        <article itemprop="articleBody" id="content">
           

<p>Today I visited one of the largest national office supply outlets. I had
a specific purpose in mind. I needed to pickup 2 wireless routers and 1
audio cable. What transpired caused me to wonder why anyone does any
offline shopping anymore.</p>

<p>My experience at the store caused me to reflect on the many things we
simply put up with at the store which we would never permit online.</p>

<p>To begin with I had to drive to the store. For me this was about a 25
minute round trip during a traffic filled rush hour. My best estimate is
that I used 2+ gallons of gas. Arriving at the parking lot, I had to
wait and circle before a spot was available. I thought “do that many
people really shop for office supplies at 6pm on a Wednesday night?”
Entering the store I realized why. It was a madhouse of teenagers and
their parents. Should have guessed, mid August = back to school. I
located the section for the networking equipment pretty quickly as it
was relatively close to the entrance and well marked. The selection was
pretty slim. They didn’t carry the model I wanted so I ended up settling
with a the next best model (with the promise of 14 days to return)
because that was the best one they carried. As I was searching through
the routers for the right one, I overheard a conversation between a
staff member and a customer. The staff member was telling the customer
how bad Vista was and all that was wrong with it. I don’t like Vista
very much, or really any MS operating system (I would pick windows 2000
if I had to choose). It was quite funny how completely wrong he was. He
was attacking Vista on all the points that were it’s strengths, and
clearly hadn’t every used it. This was the so called expert that the
brick and mortar store provide. Honestly could you ask for more. If
people really knew what they were talking about they wouldn’t be working
retail.</p>

<p>After settling on the routers, I went searching for a audio cable. This
was quite a bit harder than the routers to find. I actually ended up
circling the store a couple times as the section wasn’t marked. Because
of the large crowd of kids and parents, who both looked frazzled about
what they were doing, there were no available “can I help you” clerks
available. “It can’t be that hard to find an audio cable”. 15 minutes
later I found the only one that they stocked. It was clearly a special
cable and marked as such. An “ipod dub cable”. I don’t really know what
that means, but apparently it meant that they could charge $10 for this
standard audio cable. Principles are principles. I didn’t need that
cable enough to justify the obvious rip off going on here.</p>

<p>Lastly there was the checkout. There were two registers open and the
lines were at least 5 customers long. The cashiers didn’t know how to
handle the ‘back to school’ rush, and apparently neither did the
managers. I was in line 10 minutes before I had finally checked out. The
checkout clerk was courteous, but slow.</p>

<p>What dawned on me was that this retail store must have been employing a
good solid dozen people who did nothing more than find things for
people, and check them out. Because they were in short supply, you
always had to wait in line until one freed up to be able to help you.
The sheer amount of labor costs just maintaining the store must be
considerable.</p>

<h2 id="to-translate-my-experience-to-the-online-world">To translate my experience to the online world.</h2>

<p>It took me 15 minutes before arriving at the store. I had to pay about
$8 (gas) for the privilege of doing so. They didn’t have either of the
two items I wanted. One seemed to be close enough so instead of going
somewhere else (it would have meant quite a bit more driving and more
time I didn’t have) I bought it. There was a lot of waiting. Breaking it
down I spent</p>

<ul>
<li>25 minutes driving</li>
<li>5 minutes parking</li>
<li>25 minutes searching for 2 items.</li>
<li>10 minutes waiting for a checkout to open.</li>
<li>3 minutes checking out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Altogether the experience took well over an hour and I had to pay easily
more in gas than what shipping would have been. Unlike online where I
usually have really helpful comments from others who have used the
product I had to wait in line to have the opportunity of talking to
someone who had been trained in the art of talking about things he has
never used, nor does he actually know much about. Some online checkouts
are more painful than others, usually it is pretty quick though,
especially if you have shopped at that website before. I would just
leave if I had to wait to checkout online and go visit a website that
respected my time, but at the store this is expected. Online stores have
much larger selections and the advantage that if they either don’t carry
the item, or don’t offer it for an acceptable price, it is very easy to
go to another website. Here the driving cost alone, not to mention the
time, makes it highly inconvenient to goto another store. I knew exactly
what I wanted, but a quick search took ~ 25 minutes. Online we get
frustrated when our search results take more that 2.5 seconds. Because
there is no cost to leaving a store and going to a competitor online it
forces online shops to provide competitive prices. Many websites have
been created for the sole purpose of comparing  prices of online
retailers. As a result, online pricing is almost always quite a bit
less, even when shipping is factored in.</p>

<p>So brick and mortar stores work really well for perishable items and
some other obscure purchases, like appliances. With those as exceptions,
Why are you still shopping at brick and mortar stores? Is the ability to
touch and see and feel, and immediately have the product outweigh all
the disadvantages inherent to brick and mortar stores? <strong>Hasn’t netflix
proved the superiority of the online model?</strong></p>
