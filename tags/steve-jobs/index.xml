      <description>In 2007, All Things Digital held a fascinating interview with both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
The interview runs long and is spread out over multiple clips. I’ve only included the first handful here. Watch the rest on youtube.
It’s clear that they have a reasonably good relationship and clearly know each other well. They have a genuine and sincere respect for each other. It’s amazing how firm a grasp both have on the industry as a whole.</description>

      <description>Image via CrunchBase   Recently a book came out The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How to be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience. Jobs has mastered the art of presenting. I thought it would be interesting to look at his presentations over the years. Here are the three biggest announcements Apple has made.. iMac (Jobs first product after returning),iPod, iPhone.
Look at how his personal style has changed over the years.</description>
